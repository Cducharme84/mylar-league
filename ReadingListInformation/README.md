# Reading List Supplemental Information

This is an extension and suplement of the work at:
https://github.com/DieselTech/CBL-ReadingLists

That repository is is a colaborative and currated set of reading lists. That location serves as the master location for great reading lists (imho). In order to keep that repository clean with only the CBL files, I have posted some work that I have done to give the ability for users to view the content of a reading list prior to importing. The html file has embedded cover images as well as a CV link for each issue. The CSV and XLSX are the same data excluding the cover image. I have code that will generate a new CBL file (and html file) based on a change to the XLSX, but I need to clean that up a bit and make some documentation before I post that.

The CBLs posted here are reference only and the above site should be used for the fully tested and validated CBLs. As always let me know if you have any issues.
